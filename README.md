# Sustainability Score Evaluator

**Sustainability Score Evaluator** is an application designed to assess the sustainability practices of a user. The application prompts users to answer various sustainability-related questions and generates an optimized response using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. The output includes different texts, visual plots, and actionable insights to guide users on where they excel and where improvements can be made.

## Features

1. **Comprehensive Sustainability Assessment:**
    - Covers a wide range of sustainability aspects:
        - Energy consumption (electricity, gas, transportation)
        - Waste management (recycling, composting, reducing waste)
        - Water usage (household, gardening)
        - Diet (plant-based vs. meat-based, food waste)
        - Consumption patterns (fast fashion, electronics)
        - Travel habits (air travel, public transport)
    - Utilizes a combination of multiple-choice, rating scales, and open-ended questions.

2. **Advanced AI-Powered Insights:**
    - Employs both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for:
        - Personalized feedback tailored to individual responses.
        - Identification of key strengths and areas for improvement.
        - Generation of creative and engaging narratives around sustainability.
    - Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user responses and generate meaningful insights.

3. **Interactive Visualizations:**
    - Presents sustainability scores using:
        - Radar charts to visualize performance across different categories.
        - Bar charts to compare individual scores against benchmarks or averages.
        - Pie charts to illustrate the breakdown of energy consumption or waste generation.
    - Allows users to easily understand their overall sustainability performance and identify areas for improvement.

4. **Actionable Recommendations:**
    - Provides concrete and actionable recommendations based on individual assessments:
        - Tips for reducing energy consumption (e.g., switching to renewable energy, energy-efficient appliances)
        - Strategies for improving waste management (e.g., composting, reducing plastic usage)
        - Suggestions for adopting a more sustainable diet (e.g., incorporating more plant-based meals)
        - Guidance on sustainable transportation options (e.g., cycling, public transport)
    - Empowers users to make informed decisions and take steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle.
